    "\n",
    "# Neural Structured Learning (NSL)\n",
    "\n",
    "[Neural Structured Learning (NSL)](https://www.tensorflow.org/neural_structured_learning) provides additional training information to the neural network. [[Cite:bui2018neural]](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/46568.pdf) This training information is in the form of a graph that relates individual training cases (rows in your training set) among each other. This technique allows the neural networks to train with greater accuracy with a smaller number of labeled data.  When you eventually use the neural network for scoring and prediction, once training completes, the neural network no longer uses the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two primary sources that this graph data comes from:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Existing Graph Relationships in Data\n",
    "* Automatic Adversarial Modification of Images\n",
    "\n",
    "Often existing graph relationships may exist in data beyond just the labels that describe what individual data items are.  Consider many photo collections.  There may be collections of images placed into specific albums.  This album placement can form additional training information beyond the actual image data and labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes graph data cannot be directly obtained for a data set.  Just because you do not have a graph NSL still might be an option.  In such cases, you can make adversarial-like modifications to the data.  You can introduce additional examples and linked them to the original images in the training set.  This technique might make the final trained neural network more resilient to adversarial example attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Built into TF 2.0, supports any type of ANN.\n",

    "\n",
    "Natural Language Processing (NLP) has seen a tremendous number of advances in the past few years.  One recent technology is Bidirectional Encoder Representations from\n",
    "Transformers (BERT). [[Cite:devlin2018bert]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf) BERT achieved \"state of the art\" results in the following key NLP benchmarks:\n",

    "\n",
    "When a framework, such as BERT claims \"state of the art\" results, it is important to understand what is meant by that.  The GLUE benchmark is composed of the following parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability (CoLA)\n",
    "* Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-2)\n",
    "* Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (MRPC)    \n",
    "* Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark (STS-B)\n",
    "* Quora Question Pairs (QQP)    \n",

    "* Stanford Question Answering Dataset (QNLI)\n",
    "* Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE)\n",
    "* Winograd Schema Challenge (WNLI)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Single Sentence Tasks**\n",
    "\n",
    "CoLA and SST-2 are both single sentence tasks.  CoLA is made up of sample sentences from English grammar textbooks where the authors demonstrated acceptable and unacceptable English grammar usage.  The task in CoLA is to classify a sentence as acceptable or unacceptable.  Examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Acceptable: The angrier Sue gets, the more Fred admires her.\n",
    "* Unacceptable: The most you want, the least you eat.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task SST-2 is used to analyze sentiment.  Sentences are classified by their degree of positivity vs negativity.  For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Positive: the greatest musicians\n",
    "* Negative: lend some dignity to a dumb story\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multi-Sentence Similarity Tasks**\n",
    "\n",
    "The MRPC, QQP, and STS-B tasks look at similarity and paraphrase tasks.  The MRPC tests the AIs ability to paraphrase.  Each row contains two sentences and a target that indicates whether each pair captures a paraphrase/semantic equivalence relationship. For example, the following two sentences are considered to be equivalent:\n",
    "\n",
    "* He told The Sun newspaper that Mr. Hussein's daughters had British schools and hospitals in mind when they decided to ask for asylum .    \n",
    "* \"Saddam's daughters had British schools and hospitals in mind when they decided to ask for asylum -- especially the schools,\" he told The Sun.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, though the following two sentences look similar, they are not considered equivalent:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Gyorgy Heizler, head of the local disaster unit, said the coach was carrying 38 passengers.    \n",
    "* The head of the local disaster unit, Gyorgy Heizler, said the coach driver had failed to heed red stoplights.\n",
    "\n",
    "The QQP tasks look at if two questions are asking the same thing.  The Quora website provided this data.  Examples of sentences that are considered to ask the same question:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What are the coolest Android hacks and tricks you know?    \n",
    "* What are some cool hacks for Android phones?\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the following two questions are considered to be different in the QQP dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you received a check from Donald Knuth, what did you do, and why did you get it?\n",
    "* How can I contact Donald Knuth?\n",
    "\n",
    "The STS-B dataset evaluates how similar two sentences are. If the target/label it 0, then the two sentences are completely dissimilar.  A target value of 5 indicates that the two sentences are completely equivalent, as they\n",
    "mean the same thing.  For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Two sentences with a label of 0:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A woman is dancing.    \n",
    "* A man is talking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two sentences with a label of 5:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A plane is taking off.    \n",
    "* An airplane is taking off.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inference Tasks**\n",
    "\n",
    "The tasks MNLI, QNLI, RTE, and WNLI are all inference tasks.  The MNLI task provides two sentences that must be labeled neutral, contradiction, or entailment.  For example, the following two sentences are a contradiction:\n",
    "\n",
    "* At the end of Rue des Francs-Bourgeois is what many consider to be the city's most handsome residential square, the Place des Vosges, with its stone and red brick facades.\n",
    "* Place des Vosges is constructed entirely of gray marble.\n",
    "\n",
    "These two sentences are an entailment:\n",
    "\n",
    "* I burst through a set of cabin doors, and fell to the ground-    \n",
    "* I burst through the doors and fell down.    \n",
    "\n",
    "These two sentences are neutral:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It's not that the questions they asked weren't exciting or legitimate (though most did fall under the already asked and answered).    \n",
    "* All of the questions were interesting according to a focus group consulted on the subject.    \n",
    "\n",
    "The QNLI task poses a question and supporting sentence.  The label states if the supporting information can answer the question.  For example, the following two are labeled as \"not_entailment\":\n",
    "\n",
    "* Question: Which missile batteries often have individual launchers several kilometers from one another?    \n",
    "* Answer: When MANPADS is operated by specialists, batteries may have several dozen teams deploying separately in small sections; self-propelled air defense guns may deploy in pairs.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the following two sentences are labeled as \"entailment\":\n",
    "\n",
    "* Question: What two things does Popper argue Tarski's theory involves in an evaluation of truth?    \n",
    "* Answer: He bases this interpretation on the fact that examples such as the one described above refer to two things: assertions and the facts to which they refer.    \n",
    "\n",
    "The RTE task is similar and looks at whether one sentence entails another.  For example, the following two sentences are labeled as \"entailment\":\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lin Piao, after all, was the creator of Mao's \"Little Red Book\" of quotations.    \n",
    "* Lin Piao wrote the \"Little Red Book\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the following two sentences are labeled as \"not_entailment\".\n",
    "\n",
    "* Oil prices fall back as Yukos oil threat lifted    \n",
    "* Oil prices rise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The WNLI task checks to see if two sentences agree to a third.  For example, the following two agree:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The foxes are getting in at night and attacking the chickens. They have gotten very bold.    \n",
    "* The foxes have gotten very bold.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the following two do not agree:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sam pulled up a chair to the piano, but it was broken, so he had to stand instead.    \n",
    "* The piano was broken, so he had to stand instead.\n",
